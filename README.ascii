== My dotfiles

Just a classic dotfiles repository, feel free to clone it and resuse my stuff.
It includes some configuration for kakoune, kak-lsp, sway, waybar & more.

=== Deploying
Either clone it and symlink the files or do a git bare repository, it's up to you.

==== Little warning
I'm french and I use a very uncommon keyboard layout (azerty afnor), so make sure to modify all the keybing to fit your layout.
